## Description

In this project, I used NextJS because this is the language that I prefer since it use React and also is the best option for create a good project with this library. I need the SEO tools and I take advantage of this project for practice and learn NextJS.

## Future features

- Header sticky with blur background.
- Button up.
- Maybe update the technologies style
